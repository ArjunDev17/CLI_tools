in this repository we can see diffrent types tools

To build your Go CLI tool into a binary executable for Linux and then run it, follow these steps:

Building the Binary
Navigate to Your Project Directory:

Open a terminal and change directory to where your main.go file is located:

sh
Copy code
cd path/to/java-installer-cli
Replace path/to/java-installer-cli with the actual path to your project directory.

Build the Binary:

Use the go build command to build your Go project into a binary executable. You can specify the output name with the -o flag:

sh
Copy code
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o java-installer-cli
GOOS=linux: Specifies the target operating system as Linux.
GOARCH=amd64: Specifies the target architecture as 64-bit AMD (x86-64). Adjust this as needed for other architectures.
This command compiles your Go code and creates an executable file named java-installer-cli.

Running the Binary
After building the binary, you can run it as follows:

Run the Binary:

sh
Copy code
./java-installer-cli
This executes your CLI tool, which in your case will perform the Java installation commands as defined in cmd/root.go.

Steps Summary
To summarize, the complete steps to build and run your Go CLI tool for Linux:

Build the Binary:

cd path/to/java-installer-cli
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o java-installer-cli
Replace path/to/java-installer-cli with your actual project directory path.

Run the Binary:



./java-installer-cli
This executes your CLI tool and performs the specified Java installation commands.




chmod +x java-installer-cli
Run the Binary:

Finally, execute the CLI tool:

./java-installer-cli


## CHECK VERSION
If you want to share the built CLI tool with others and ensure they can execute the command on their systems, follow these steps:

Step 1: Build the Binary
First, build the binary for your target operating system and architecture. For example, to build for a 64-bit Linux system, run:

sh
Copy code
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o version-checker
If you want to build for Windows or macOS, you can set the appropriate GOOS and GOARCH values. Here are a few examples:

For Windows 64-bit:

sh
Copy code
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o version-checker.exe
For macOS 64-bit:

sh
Copy code
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o version-checker
Step 2: Distribute the Binary
Share the built binary (version-checker or version-checker.exe) with others. You can distribute it via email, cloud storage, or any other file-sharing method.

Step 3: Ensure Dependencies are Installed
Make sure the target systems have Go, Java, MongoDB, and MySQL installed, as the CLI tool depends on their commands to fetch versions. You can provide instructions to install these dependencies if they are not already installed.

Step 4: Execution Permissions (Linux/macOS)
For Linux or macOS, the recipient might need to give the binary execution permissions:

sh
Copy code
chmod +x version-checker
Step 5: Run the CLI Tool
On the target system, they can run the CLI tool to check versions:

On Linux/macOS:

sh
Copy code
./version-checker check
On Windows:

sh
Copy code
version-checker.exe check
Step-by-Step Instructions for the Recipient
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide you can provide to the recipients:

Download the Binary: Download the version-checker binary file (or version-checker.exe for Windows) from the shared location.

Move to Desired Location: Move the binary to a desired location on your system. For example:

sh
Copy code
mv ~/Downloads/version-checker ~/my-tools/
cd ~/my-tools/
Give Execution Permission (Linux/macOS):

sh
Copy code
chmod +x version-checker
Ensure Dependencies are Installed: Make sure Go, Java, MongoDB, and MySQL are installed on your system. Here are some commands to check:

Go: go version
Java: java -version
MongoDB: mongo --version
MySQL: mysql --version
Run the CLI Tool:

On Linux/macOS:

sh
Copy code
./version-checker check
On Windows:

sh
Copy code
version-checker.exe check
By following these steps, the recipients will be able to execute the version-checker command to check the versions of Go, Java, MongoDB, and MySQL on their systems.
